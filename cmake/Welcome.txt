Similar to a Bloom filter, a Cuckoo filter provides a space-efficient data structure designed to answer approximate set-membership queries (e.g. "is item x contained in this set?") Unlike standard Bloom filters, however, Cuckoo filters support deletion. Likewise, Cuckoo filters are more optimal than Bloom variants which support deletion, such as counting Bloom filters, in both space and time.
